This was my first project at the ExcelR Solutions.
A Time Series Analysis Project where we had to forecast the future price of the Gold based on the past 6 years of data.
We tried different Time Series Analysis Models including Arima, LSTM, Linear etc.
We finalized the FBProphet Model as it was most suitable according to the our Analysis.
Doing the Deployment using the Streamlit on webapp which is compatible with the Python Language.
